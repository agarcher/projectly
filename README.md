# Projectly

This is a very basic MVP of a project management interface for a project using a DevOps toolchain. It allows users to create links to all the tools used for a given project and keep them in a stable place. The goal is to validate if this high level view of the toolchain is something users would actually find useful.

## Prereqs

 - Install node v10 or greater.
 - Install bower globally.

```sh
$ npm install -g bower
```

 - Install gulp globally.

```sh
$ npm install --global gulp
```

## Usage

Clone the repo, navigate to it and start the app via:

```sh
$ gulp watch
```
